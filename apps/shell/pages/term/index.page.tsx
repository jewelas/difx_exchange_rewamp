                <br />
                4.9.4 By accessing the Platform and utilizing relevant Services
                in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks
                associated with cryptographic tokens, digital assets, digital
                ledger technology, and blockchain-based software systems; and
                warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and
                intricacies of native cryptographic tokens and its underlying
                technology, such as the blockchain- based software systems;
                <br />
                <br />
                4.9.5 the Platform and the Services may be impacted by one or
                more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could
                impede or limit the ability of DIFX to continue to develop, or
                which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the
                Platform and/or the Services;
                <br />
                <br />
                4.9.6 Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code
                cracking or technical advances such as the development of
                quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies and the
                Platform and the Services, which could result in the theft or
                loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. To the extent
                possible, DIFX intends to update the protocol underlying the
                Platform and the Services to account for any advances in
                cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures,
                but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of
                the system. By using the Platform and the Services, you
                acknowledge these inherent risks;
                <br />
                <br />
                4.9.7 You understand that blockchain technologies and associated
                currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors
                including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology,
                and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of
                transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at
                any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the
                blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent that DIFX
                cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs;
                <br />
                <br />
                4.9.8 The Platform and/or the Service provides links to other

                loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use
                of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available
                on or through any such site or resource.

                <span>6. RISK DISCLOSURES</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                6.1 <span>Trading risks:</span> You acknowledge and agree that
                you shall access and use the Services at your own risk. The risk
                of loss in trading Digital Asset pairs and Digital Asset and
                Legal Tender pairs can be substantial. You should, therefore,
                carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in
                light of your circumstances and financial resources. You should
                be aware of the following points:
                <br />
                <br />
                6.1.1 You may sustain a total loss of the Funds in your DIFX
                Account, and, in some cases, you may incur losses beyond such
                Funds.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.1.2 Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult
                or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for
                example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit
                or there is insufficient liquidity in the market.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.1.3 Placing contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or
                "stop-limit" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to
                the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it
                impossible to execute such orders.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.1.4 All Digital Asset positions involve risk, and a "spread"
                position may not be less risky than an outright "long" or
                "short" position.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.1.5 The use of leverage can work against you as well as for
                you and can lead to large losses as well as gains.
                <br />
                <br />
                ALL OF THE POINTS NOTED ABOVE APPLY TO ALL DIGITAL ASSET PAIR
                AND DIGITAL ASSET AND LEGAL TENDER PAIR TRADING. THIS BRIEF
                STATEMENT CAN NOT, OF COURSE, DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER
                ASPECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TRADES.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.2 Internet transmission risks. You acknowledge that there are
                risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading system
                including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware,
                software, and Internet connections. You acknowledge that

                assumptions about DIFX, may include, but are not limited to,
                projections of future financial performance of relevant products
                based on our relevant strategies and anticipated trends in our
                business and industry, statements concerning DIFX’ plans,
                objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements
                that are not historical or current facts. Forward-looking
                statements are only predictions based on our current
                expectations about future events. They involve risks and
                uncertainties that could cause actual results, level of
                activity, or performance to differ materially from those
                expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors
                that lead to DIFX’ performance to differ materially from current
                expectations include, but are not limited to: implementation of
                strategic initiatives, economic, political, and market
                conditions and fluctuations, government and industry regulation,
                interest rate risk and market competition. These risks and
                uncertainties are not exhaustive and forward-looking statements
                are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change.
                We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
                environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to
                time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and
                uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact that these factors
                will have on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
                combination of factors, may cause actual results, level of
                activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from
                those contained in any forward-looking statements. Our inclusion
                of such projections in any report or document should not be
                regarded as a representation that the projections will prove to
                be correct. We do not assume responsibility for the accuracy or
                completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You
                should not rely upon forward- looking statements as predictions
                of future events. We are under no duty to update any of these
                forward-looking statements after the date of any report to
                conform our prior statements to actual results or revised
                expectations and we do not intend to do so.

                unless you notify DIFX to the contrary within five (5) Business

                shall be issued and notified through the Platform or Service

                20.9 Cancellations. You may only cancel an order initiated via
                the Services if such cancellation occurs before it executes the
                transaction. Once your order has been executed, you may not
                change, withdraw or cancel your authorization to complete such
                transaction. If an order has been partially filled, you may
                cancel the unfilled remainder unless the order relates to a
                market trade. We reserve the right to refuse any cancellation
                request associated with a market order once you have submitted
                such an order. In contrast to exchange orders, all trades are
                irreversible once initiated. While we may, at our sole
                discretion, reverse a trade under certain extraordinary
                conditions, a customer does not have a right to a reversal of a
                trade.

                Funds in your DIFX Account to complete an order via the
                Services, we may cancel the entire order or may fulfil a partial
                order using the amount of Funds currently available in your DIFX
                Account, less any fees owed to service provider in connection
                with our execution of the trade
